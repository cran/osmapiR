    <text>Hello,

you changed the catalan name of the river &quot;Le Boulès&quot; from &quot;El Boles&quot; to &quot;El Bulès&quot; because this is the official catalan toponym from your point of view. Could you please specify the source of this assertion ? The only quasi official source for north catalan toponyms I know are the publications of Joan Becat he established in collaboration with local authorities and which are generally used by the local OSM community. In https://joanbecat.cat/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fr-Web-jbk-cadastre_Bouleterne%CC%80re.pdf, he uses &quot;El Bolès&quot;, so I propose to use this ortography as well in OSM.

    <text>Bon dia,

An official toponym does not depend on a person's point of view, precisely that makes it official. In this case, it was well stablished in the publication 'Nomenclàtor toponímic de la Catalunya del Nord' (2007) by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans and the University of Perpinyà. You can download it from here: https://publicacions.iec.cat/repository/pdf/00000044/00000018.pdf

Plus, el Bulès is also the spelling used by the Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana: https://www.enciclopedia.cat/gran-enciclopedia-catalana/el-bules

I am well aware of Joan Becat's works, which are very useful and meaningful in many aspects (historic, geographic, etc.) but they lack a proper authority control in the chosen toponymia.

I have a proficiency degree in Catalan (which is my mother tongue) and I would never change a toponym unless I was very sure it is not correctly written. Anyway, thanks for the controlling :)

Salut!</text>

    <text>Thanks for your rapid answer and for the references. I would say, both spellings are usal. Even the eciclopèdia mentions &quot;riu del Bolès&quot;. It seems that Bolès is more frequent in french context, for example: http://www.sandre.eaufrance.fr/geo/CoursEau_Carthage2017/Y0460600
I will add loc_name=&quot;El Bolès&quot; and add both name=&quot;El Bulès&quot; and loc_name=&quot;El Bolès&quot;  to all parts of the waterway, not only just to one single part of it.   </text>

    <text>Hello again,

Sorry for the answering delay, I was off home for several days.

As you said, &quot;Bolès&quot; is indeed more frequent in French context because unfortunately in France the Catalan language has very scarce official recognition and the general toponymia still lacks of authorised control. The French administration switched three centuries ago all the Catalan names to French, which is the unique official toponym for many of them, and this deturpation in the correct spelling when recovering the original Catalan names is still problematic nowadays due to sociolinguistic issues such as minorisation and diglossia.

The name Bulès comes after the village Bula, as explained by ethymologist and linguist Dr. Joan Coromines in the Onomasticon Cataloniae (free access: https://oncat.iec.cat/veuredoc.asp?id=11213). The same is stated in the Nomenclator approved by the Northern Catalonia's University in Perpinyà, which I linked in the previous message. Hence, in Catalan it should be written Bulès, no matter if the French administration is mispelling the name even when trying to write it in Catalan...

All things considered, adding a &quot;local name&quot; which is not the original Catalan one (el Bulès) nor the official French deturpation (le Boulès) will turn the case even more confusing as it already is!

Anyway, thanks for your kind answer and your help (I'm new in OSM and did'nt know I wasn't changing the name of the whole waterway).
