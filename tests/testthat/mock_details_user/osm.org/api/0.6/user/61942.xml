  <description>I live near York (UK), though I do occasionally [venture further afield](http://yosmhm.neis-one.org/?zoom=6&amp;lat=53.08324&amp;lon=-2.42578&amp;layers=B000TTF&amp;u=SomeoneElse).
I mainly map footpaths and other out-of-town things.  Also see related profile on 
&lt;a rel="me" href="https://en.osm.town/@SomeoneElse"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.

There are some bits and pieces (including [two](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-style) [parts](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/openstreetmap-carto-AJT) of an OSM-Carto-derived rendering style designed for out-of-town England and Wales) over at [Github](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM) that look like [this](https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html).  There are some wiki pages behind [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:SomeoneElse) (mostly to do with tileserver setup).  

I'm a member of the [Data Working Group](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Data_working_group) (that's what the blue star above means), but if you've got any issues to raise with the DWG the [group email address](http://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Data_Working_Group#Contact) is the best one to use.  

Other related accounts are [SomeoneElse2](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SomeoneElse2). [SomeoneElseSC](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SomeoneElseSC) and [SomeoneElse_Revert](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SomeoneElse_Revert), which is mainly used where people have requested that I help with reversions.

The "User id" of this account is "61942".  I mention that because there have been a few attempts over the years to impersonate DWG members, including me, using names such as "SomeoneEIse" (with a capital "i" instead of a lower case "l") and others with various UTF-8 versions of characters that look similar to, but are not, regular ascii characters.</description>
